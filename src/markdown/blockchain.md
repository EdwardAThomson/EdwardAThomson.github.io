## My background in blockchain

I've been following Bitcoin on and off since 2010 although only started working professionally in the space since early 2018. Learning about Bitcoin spurred me to learn about cryptography and eventually led me down the path of studying for an MSc in Information Security. Getting jobs with a PhD in Astrophysics turned out to be harder than expected!

While I was previously involved with building out the Polkadot ecosystem, I do take a fairly agnostic approach to blockchain and don't believe there is a one-size-fits-all. 

I still offer consultancy in this space, although worth noting that in 2025 the blockchain scene looks very different from how it did in previous years. There are far too many tokens now. I outline how we should move forwards with regards to tokens in a blog: [New token-issuance norms for Web3](https://medium.com/@edward-thomson/new-token-issuance-norms-for-web3-256b100ca891)

## Open Accelerator
The [Open Accelerator](https://edwards-organization-16.gitbook.io/open-accelerator-for-blockchain-startups/) is a free resource to help blockchain startups get from idea to launch. Whether you're just brainstorming or gearing up for a big launch, this guide has got you covered.

I created this resource as a way to help teams help themselves. The knowledge was essentially hidden from new teams and worse still, it was disseminated by less-than-scrupulous acceleration programs.

There are many accelerators available for blockchain teams, not all of them prioritize the long-term success of the projects they support. Traditional accelerators often have mixed incentives, focusing on short-term financial gains over sustainable growth. The Open Accelerator, by contrast, is a free resource designed to provide transparent, unbiased guidance. There are no costs involved, and while there won't be direct handholding, the resource is comprehensive enough to guide you through the entire process, from ideation to launch.

## The Crypto Angel Investor Checklist
Over the past few years, my journey as an advisor and angel investor in the blockchain industry has afforded me a unique perspective on the early stages of startup development, especially in fundraising.

In the past, I’ve created helpful resources like [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRaJOERxiNUds7Ru21TZ3nUHdDH7fPeQm) and a [pitch deck template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VHUszlBk6ta-x-74y5LnbzG65tKhobRH0mSAEQOde7c/edit#slide=id.p). However, I recognize the limitations of these tools and plan to develop a more comprehensive resource in the future. This led me to create a new and robust tool: the [Crypto Angel Investment Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHbaKv-9rAW1f1QNutihbQBEutKOiJIPHlkkVZ03UE0/edit?gid=1774752715#gid=1774752715).

## Web 3 Foundation

During my time at the **Web 3 Foundation** (in Zug, Switzerland), I  covered numerous responsibilities including technical writing, technical education, security, collaboration, community management, and grants.

I helped to promote our activities by engaging the community with thoughtful communication (including writing technical blogs and answering questions). I was also heavily involved in the collaboration ("business development") efforts to bring in new teams to work within the Polkadot ecosystem. Part of my collaboration efforts revolve around engaging our community with regards to our grants program.

## Grants Experience

I helped to create the grants program back at the end of 2019, and covered every aspect of the program since I was the only person in the foundation covering grants then.

Here are the key tasks in managing the pipeline:

- Finding teams to build out the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Helping the teams through the application process.
- Reviewing applications.
- Preparing the legal contracts.
- Assessing the technical deliverables (compiling and running code!) and comparing to the contract.
- Writing the winners' blog post each quarter.


## Understanding Blockchain

I have written numerous blogs on blockchain technology and the ecosystem. I have a diverse interest within the space covering topics from technical deep-dives to getting a bank account!
