## Information Security Experience

In the not so distance past I worked as a security consultant at Portcullis Computer Security in London. The company was acquired by Cisco. This work as a continuation of the Information Security MSc that I did at Royal Holloway in 2014-2015.

My role was initially that of a penetration tester. I mainly reviewed the security of websites (“web apps”), but also network infrastructure, and host reviews (“build reviews”).

During my time at Cisco I pivoted to cover more on the soft side of security, which is often known as GRC (governance, risk, and compliance). During this time, I picked up certificates for ISO 27001 Implementation and ISO27005 Risk Management.
