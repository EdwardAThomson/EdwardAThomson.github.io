![Profile Picture](../images/edthomson_linkedin.jpg)

I currently work as an advisor and consultant in the blockchain space, collaborating with innovative teams and investors focused on gaming, NFTs, and to an extent the Polkadot ecosystem. My views are fairly chain agnostic and so when I consult with teams I'm picking the right technology that works for the them. Not all blockchains are equal, so it is worth aiming for the right solution for a given problem.

Previously, I was part of the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/) team, where I managed the grants program. The foundation lead the stewardship of the [Polkadot Network](https://polkadot.com/), a next-generation blockchain platform.

I'm deeply passionate about exploring cutting-edge technologies, particularly [blockchain](./blockchain/) and [AI](./AI/), and continuously seek opportunities to engage with innovative projects at the forefront of these fields.
